The `ghz` command line has numerous command line options.  You can run `ghz --help` to view all available options. 

<AUTOGENERATED_TABLE_OF_CONTENTS>

### `-proto`

The protocol buffer file for input.

### `-protoset`

Alternatively we use use compiled protoset file (containing compiled descriptors, produced by `protoc`) as input.
To create a protoset file, invoke `protoc` with the `*.proto` files that define the service. For example:

```sh
protoc --proto_path=. \
    --descriptor_set_out=myservice.protoset \
    --include_imports \
    my/custom/server/service.proto
```

### `-call`

A fully-qualified method name in 'package/service/method' or 'package.service.method' format. For example: `helloworld.Greeter.SayHello`.

### `-cert`

By default `ghz` tries to create a secure connection using the system's default root certificate. The certificate file can be specified using `-cert` option. Ignored if `-insecure` is specified.

### `-cname`

An override of the expected server Cname presented by the server.

### `-insecure`

 Specify for non TLS connection.

 ### `-config`

 Path to the JSON or TOML [config file](example_config.md) that specifies all the test settings.

 ### `-c`

 Number of requests to run concurrently. Total number of requests cannot be smaller than the concurrency level. Default is `50`. For example to do requests in series without any concurrency set to `1`. 

 ### `-n`

 The total number of requests to run. Default is `200`. The combination of `-c` and `-n` are critical in how the benchmarking is done. `ghz` takes the `-c` argument and spawns that make worker goroutines. In parallel these goroutines each do their share (`c / n`) requests. So for example with the default `-c 50 -n 200` options we would spawn `50` goroutines which in parallel each do `40` requests. 

### `-q`

Rate limit for each worker goroutine in queries per second (QPS). Default is no rate limit.

### `-t`

Timeout for each request in seconds. Default is `20`, use 0 for infinite.

### `-z`

Duration of application to send requests. When duration is reached, application stops and exits. If duration is specified, `n` is ignored. Examples: `-z 10s` or `-z 3m`.

### `-x`

Maximum duration of application to send requests with `n` setting respected. If duration is reached before `n` requests are completed, application stops and exits. Examples: `-x 10s` or `-x 3m`.

### `-d`
The call data as stringified JSON. If the value is `@` then the request contents are read from standard input (stdin). Example: `-d '{"name":"Bob"}'`.
